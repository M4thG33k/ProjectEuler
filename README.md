# ProjectEuler
These are my Java solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. They aren't necessary optimal
solutions, but no solution is uploaded without producing a correct answer. Feel free to use these as a resource for
solving the problems yourself, but please don't just copy/paste. The goal of Project Euler is to challenge you and to
learn as you go - copying solutions doesn't help you at all. :-)
